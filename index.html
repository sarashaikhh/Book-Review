   Book Review: “Dear Lulu, Please try and print these line, colour, pattern, format, texture and typography tests for us.”

<h3>
    Summary: 
</h3>


<p>
    The book “Dear Lulu, Please try and print these line, colour, pattern, format, texture and typography tests for us.” was a sort of test put together by the students of artist, James Goggin, within a graphic design workshop. The format of this text consists of (in this order) a series of portraits, an explanation of the project, patterns and lines, photographs of skin, fonts, gradients, blacks, type sizing, textures, and measurements. This project was created to see what the printing company Lulu.com was capable of and how designs would translate after being published.

Gestalt principles used:
</h3>
    
<p>
    Throughout the book, they use different Gestalt principles in each section. The usage of proximity organizes content into distinct sections, facilitating clarity and understanding. Similarly, maintaining the placement consistency of captions can fall under the principle of similarity, creating visual patterns that enhance overall cohesion. Repetition is skillfully employed, creating a sense of unity and rhythm throughout. The use of closure, particularly in the typography sections, where some words are intentionally cut off yet remain intelligible, engages the viewer in a participatory visual experience. Additionally, we can see that in the gradients when some of the words blend out, but we still know what they are saying. Furthermore, the incorporation of the continuation principle, seen in the depiction of a cutting motion and the zooming photos of skin series, adds a dynamic quality to the composition.

<h3>
Conclusion: 
</h3>

<p>
In conclusion, I find this book to be very fun and interesting. Even though it started out as just an experiment I find it very visually pleasing and utilizes overall design elements well. For other designers, this book would also be useful in giving ideas and also showing how effective Lulu.com is. I enjoy the inside perspective on the different elements that need to be considered and also the considerations that need to happen in the book designing process.
